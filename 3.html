<p>"This course is one of the best I have seen, anywhere. I have done many courses from other providers. They tend to just teach you syntax, this course teaches the syntax but also why the syntax is the way it is. It gives you an understanding of how the language really works. It is definitely a beginners course in terms of the techniques that it covers but it covers those areas in great depth and detail giving you a very solid base from which to advance. Really excellent stuff that I cannot recommend enough!"</P>
